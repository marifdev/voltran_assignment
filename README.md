# voltran_assignment

In this app, there are 4 steps to complete the assignment. Every step is a separate branch. You can check the branches to see the code for each step. Each branch has a README.md file to explain the step.

Main branch is for step 1.

## Step 1: Change the default flutter app (flutter create myapp) to record user taps on FAB, but not incrementing the number right after each tabs. By long pressing the FAB, number starts to increment with the exact timing user tapped the FAB. There should be no limitation for number of taps and different sequence of delay between the taps. So in another word you should record user tap count and the time between each tab, and increment the number with the same delays on the screen just after long press happened on the button. Somehow, it simulates the user actions and we can run it later. For example: I tap on the button 3 times so fast, I wait 1 second and I tap 2 times fast again, now the number is still zero on the screen. I will long press the button and the number goes to 3 so fast, it waits 1 second and it reaches 5 afterward.
